    "This longitudinal open data file includes information about the graduation rates for schools broken out by: graduation rate type (four-year, five-year, or six-year), demographic category (EL status, IEP status, Economically Disadvantaged Status, Gender, or Ethnicity), and ninth-grade cohort. Students are attributed to the last school at which they actively attended in the respective graduation window, which ends on September 30 each year. Students are classified as EL, as having an IEP, and/or economically disadvantaged if they were designated as such at any point during their high school career.\n",

One could look at whether there is a statistically significance difference in scores between two schools, investigate trends over time, or look at different groups an subgroups.
