    "# Indego Bikes: Do electric bikes tempt riders to go faster?\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><b>Abstract</b></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Bike-share programs are increasingly popular in cities around the world. Following successful programs in Amsterdam, Paris, and Copenhagen, the City of Philadelphia launched Indego Bikes in 2015. Indego currently maintains a fleet of over 2,000 bicycles, more than half of which are electric bicycles. Urban cycling can be dangerous. To investigate whether riders travel faster on electric bicycles, we compared the duration of trips made using standard and electric bicycles between a pair of stations two miles apart in downtown Philadelphia. Based on a sample of 142 trips in the third quarter of 2023 (94 electric, 48 standard), trips on electric bicycles averaged 0.64 minutes shorter (12.34 versus 12.98 minutes) than trips on standard bicycles. A simulation-based hypothesis test indicates we can reject the null hypothesis at the 95% confidence level—but not at 99%—suggesting a modest but statistically significant difference in mean trip duration. However, the effect size is small (about 40 seconds on a two-mile ride) and likely of limited practical importance; these results do not support the conclusion that riders of electric bicycles are at greater risk solely due to speed.\n"

    "The distributions hinted that the riders might be slightly quicker on electric bikes. Our simulations show that we can reject the null hypothesis with 95% confidence, but not 99% confidence. Thus, we conclude the riders might be significantly faster on electric bikes, at least for a two mile ride in the city.\n",

    "The **effect size**, however appears to be small. Does anyone care if we shave 40 seconds off of a two-mile commuter ride? Unlikely. Sometimes even results that are \"statistically signficant\" do not have practical importance. It does not appear the ebike riders are taking greater risks becuase they are not going that much faster."
