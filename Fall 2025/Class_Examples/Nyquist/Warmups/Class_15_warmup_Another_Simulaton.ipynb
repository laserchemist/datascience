    "# The Question that Started Probability Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "\"De Méré's problem is a question posed in the mid-seventeenth century to Blaise Pascal by a French nobleman and inveterate gambler, the Chevalier de Méré, which marked the birth of probability theory. One of de Méré's favorite bets was that at least one six would appear during a total of four rolls of a die. From past experience, he knew that this gamble paid off more often than not. Then, for a change, he started betting that he would get a double-six on 24 rolls of two dice. However, he soon realized that his old approach to the game was more profitable. He asked his friend Pascal why. Pascal showed that the probability of getting at least one six in four rolls of a die is 1 - (5/6)4 ~ 0.5177, which is slightly higher than the probability of at least one double-six in 24 throws of two dice, 1 - (35/36)24 ~ 0.4914.\"\n",
