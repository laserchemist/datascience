Tables are described in [Chapter 6](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/06/Tables.html) of the Inferential Thinking text. A related approach in Python programming is to use what is known as a [pandas dataframe](https://pythonbasics.org/pandas-dataframe/) which we will need to resort to occasionally. Pandas is a mainstay data science tool.\n",
