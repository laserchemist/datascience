    "Professor Roger del Morales at University of Washington https://faculty.washington.edu/moral/ and his team set up circular, 9 meter radius, land plots near the volcano once it was safe to initiate the study in 1984. These plots are located in several distinct regions near the volcano cone to study the return of vegetation and biodiversity to these plots located in different positions relative to the volcanic cone (see mapping below). We will use this data to assess the rate of plant succession. Measures in the data include yearly species richness, *RICHNESS*, defined as the number of species in a given region or in this case the 9-meter radius (250 $m^2$) land plot. We will use our data science tools to decide if the changes over time in *RICHNESS* are a pattern (Alternate hypothesis) or if they are just due to random fluctuations (NULL hypothesis). We will also study *COVER_%*, a measure that reflects plant coverage. In this case we will test whether growth has occurred following the eruption. Plots are studied in 13 unique locations with different characteristics including the blast type which they experienced. In designing their study, the researchers also collected data in up to 10 adjacent plots with the same name in order to assess statistical variation across an area. \n",
