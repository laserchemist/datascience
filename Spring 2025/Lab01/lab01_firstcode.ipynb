Once you have completed all sections and annotated your code (# Comments and markdown, to be explained) you will download a copy in .html and .ipynb format for submission to Canvas.\n",

    "Discussion of questions on labs is more than okay -- it's encouraged! You should rarely be stuck for an inordinate amount of time on questions in labs, so ask a neighbor, course assistant, or an instructor for help. (Explaining things is beneficial, too -- the best way to solidify your knowledge of a subject is to explain it.) **Please don't just share answers, though**. Pushing to understand coding and data challenges using class resources, online texts, and even Web searches can help build a stronger understanding. Everyone finds challenges in completing some parts of the laboratories. This is a natural part of the learning process but you will become more fluent in the tools and concepts of Data Science with perserverance!\n",
