If we extrapolate that motion backwards to the time when everything in the universe was in the same place, that time is (roughly) the beginning of the universe!\n",

If not, can we reject the null hypothesis that there is no correlation between close nova speed and distance?  Compare your result to the [Planck project 2015 results](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.01589.pdf), which estimated the age of the universe to be 13.799±0.021 billion years. Is the accepted age of the universe in this range? Conceptually, how did the bootstrap estimation of the uncertainty work?"
