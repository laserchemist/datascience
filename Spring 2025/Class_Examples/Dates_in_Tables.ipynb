    "### Dates and times in Tables\n",
    "One thing that is more complicated then we would like but is a common need for a data scientist is encoding data and time. Computer operating systems like Windows and Linux use as a reference point or epoch January 1, 1970 and determine the number of seconds since midnight the start of 1970 to do time computations. That way the computer can store each date as a simple integer representing the number of seconds since the epoch. Working with dates can be tricky. Fortunately, Python has a module (library of functions) that helps! <br>\n",
