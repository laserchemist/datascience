    "In celebration of the Olympic spirit we will analyze trends in a data set which spans the from the 1896 Athens games to Rio in 2016. With this data we will explore trends in medals awarded, sports, and countries, as well as any host country advantage. The dataset is from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com ), a data science dataset, coding, and competition site. The mini-project represents your first chance to try out your coding and data skills to address specific questions without template code. Look to your previous labs and our work in class for ideas.\n",
