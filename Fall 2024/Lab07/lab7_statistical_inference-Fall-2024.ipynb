    "Climate change is usually referring to the general trend of warming temperatures globally.  Along with these increasing temperatures, unusual shifts in trends in weather activity such as hurricanes, storms, winds, etc are also usually classified under climate change.  While the climate can shift due to natural occurrences, scientists have found that human interventions have contributed to the trend of warming.  One explanation for the warming could be increased solar solar activity, however scientists have found that solar activity has not generally increased during the period when temperature has increased.  \n",

    "You can think of this this way: the signal in your data is the difference between the two means -- before and after treatment -- or in our case, between two different time periods. The noise is the variation of the data around the the means (standard deviation). If the signal is large compared with the noise, we can reject the null hypothesis, but if difference between the means is small compared with the scatter of the data around the means, the distributions will blur together and we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the observations could be the result of random variation.\n",

Values of the t-statistic that are greater then or equal to the value in the table have a maximal value of p from the table.
