    "### Motivation\n",
    "Sir Isaac Newton, the famous scientist and mathematician, once said, “If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.” Every scientific study builds on the work of others. You don't want to reinvent the wheel. You also need domain knowledge -- you wouldn't expect a biologist to analyze data from the Hubble telescope, or an astronomer to report on DNA sequencing. At least not without reading up on the topic. So before you begin exploring your data, you need to *read.* Scientific journal articles always begin with a literature review that discussed previous research and points the reader to related studies. The literature review puts the current paper in context.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin the miniproject with some background information. You are encouraged to dig deeper on your own to explore any related resources. The less you know about a topic, the more background reading you need to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background: Pennypack Creek Water Quality\n",
    "The data set you will be analyzing was provided by Dr. Laura Toran of Temple's Department of Earth and Environmental Science. Much of Dr. Toran's research has focused on how the urban environment affects the water quality of streams in Philadelphia and the surrounding suburbs. She has conducted this research with the help of numerous Temple graduate students, and undergraduate researchers like the ones in the photos below, all photographed while sampling Pennypack Creek.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Undergrad researcher sampling the Pennypack](./data/sampling_side_by_side.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Pennypack Creek is a small stream that begins in the suburbs north of Phildelphia, flows through the northeast portion of the city and discharges into the Delaware River. The data set you will be working with is a \"synoptic sample.\" In environmental science, synoptic sampling refers to the process of collecting samples from different locations within a study area during a single, short time period—essentially taking a “snapshot” of conditions across space, rather than over time. So you will be looking at data from water samples all collected on the same day but at points spanning the length of the stream. Your goal will be to examine how the geochemistry of the stream varies from the headwaters to where it discharges to the Delaware.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many natural tributaries contribute to the flow of Pennypack Creek, but you will focus on a manmade source, a wastewater treatment plant run by the Upper Moreland Hatburo Joint Sewer Authority. You can read more about the plant [here.](https://www.umhjsa.org/about.html#:~:text=Recent%20plant%20upgrades,environmental%20compliance). The aerial image below shows the location of the treatment plant relative to the creek, and the photo shows the plant discharging into the Pennypack.\n",

    "\"Univariate\" means one variable. We have three anions of interest: Cl, Nitrate-N, and SO4. In this section we will explore them one at a time. Later we will look at them in combination (\"multivariate\").\n",
    "\n",
    "But first, lets provide some more background.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cl is chloride:** typically a measure of the salinity (NaCl) of the water. In urban streams, elevated salinity is mainly caused by road salt runoff and wastewater. The concentration is reported in mg/L (milligrams per liter). A liter of water has a mass of 1,000 grams, and a milligram is one thousandth of a gram, so 1 mg/L is equivalent 1 part in a million or 1 ppm. While not usually a health risk at the current concentrations, water that is too salty it is bad for aquatic life and tastes lousy. **The EPA drinking water standard for chloride is 250 mg/L.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nitrate-N:** When you see “Nitrate-N” (or “NO₃-N”) in water quality data, it means the concentration is reported as the mass of nitrogen (N) contained within the nitrate ion, rather than the total mass of the nitrate molecule. Reporting as Nitrate-N allows for direct comparison between different forms of nitrogen (like nitrate, nitrite, or ammonia), since all are expressed as the mass of nitrogen. This is important for regulatory standards and health guidelines, which are typically based on the nitrogen content, not the full molecule. **[Drinking water standards](https://www.epa.gov/sdwa/drinking-water-regulations-and-contaminants) (such as the EPA’s 10 mg/L limit for nitrate-N for adults and 5 mg/L for children) are based on the nitrogen portion, making it easier to compare risks from different nitrogen compounds.⁠ High nitrate level are a particular problem for infants, causing \"Blue Baby Syndrome\" as it can interfere with the blood's ability to carry oxygen.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**SO4:** is sulfate. It can occur naturally from rock weathering and decay of organic matter, or through human actions such as fertilizer runoff, acid rain, weathering of concrete, and municipal wastewater from sewage treatment plants. Apart from creating an unpleasant taste, really high levels of sulfate (>500 mg/L) can cause diarrhea and other digestive issues. **The EPA drinking water standard for sulfate is 250 mg/L.**"
