She rolls a 20-sided die, adds a modifier of 11 to the result (because her character is good at knocking down doors), and *succeeds if the total is greater than 15*.<br> A Medium posting discusses probability in the context of Dungeons and Dragons https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-probability-theory-with-dungeons-and-dragons-a36bc69aec88 <br><br><img src= data/DnD.JPG height=\"200\"><br>\n",

    "DNA within a cell contains codes or sequences for the ultimate synthesis of proteins. In DNA is made up of four types of nucleotides, guanine (G), cytosine (C), adenine (A), and thymine (T) connected in an ordered sequence. These nucleotides on a single strand pair with complimentary nucleotides on a second strand, G pairs with C and A with T. Regions of DNA code for RNA which ultimately directs protein synthesis and these segments are known as genes and these segments often have higher GC content. Here we will sample 10 nuclotide segments of a DNA sequence and determine the GC content of these DNA segments.

    "#### Dictionaries\n",
    "A Python dictionary stores values in pairs, a key and a value. For example when we considered the height in meters of each of the Adirondack High Peaks in Lab 02 we had values representing the height in meters without a label. With a dictionary we could use the name of the mountain as a key with the height as a value. Below we will use a dictionary to store the number of times a letter occurs. Run the below cells to see how dictionaries work."
