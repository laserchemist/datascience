    "In Lab 1, you will carry out some initial coding practice. You follow the instructions in the notebook to complete the assignment. Once you have completed all sections and annotated your code (# Comments and markdown, to be explained) you will download a copy in .html and .ipynb format for submission to Canvas.\n",

    "Discussion of questions on labs is more than okay -- it's encouraged! You should rarely be stuck for an inordinate amount of time on questions in labs, so ask a neighbor, course assistant, or an instructor for help. (Explaining things is beneficial, too -- the best way to solidify your knowledge of a subject is to explain it.) Please don't just share answers, though. Pushing to understand coding and data challenges using class resources, online texts, and even Web searches can help build a stronger understanding. Everyone finds challenges in completing some of the parts of the laboratories, this is a natural part of the learning process but you will become more fluent in the tools and concepts of Data Science with perserverance!\n",
